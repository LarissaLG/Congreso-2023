**Abstract:**  
In daily life, and even more so in the scientific field, there is a need to remotely monitor workspaces so they can be automatically kept stable using actuators that respond to changes in the physical variables of interest. Some examples of such systems include large-scale greenhouses, incubators, and hydroponic systems, among others.

Based on the above, a **closed-loop feedback system** was developed to maintain stable physical variables such as temperature and humidity. This system was mathematically modeled, and the model was applied to a mini-greenhouse to later corroborate its physical-mathematical behavior.

For the construction of this mini-greenhouse, **DHT-11** and **FC-28 sensors** were used to monitor temperature and humidity. For the user interface, **Internet of Things (IoT)** techniques were employed, such as a **Telegram bot**. Finally, to keep the variables within the desired range, a lighting, ventilation, and irrigation system was implemented with various actuators.
